	Writing a book is hard.  Maintaining a book is even harder.  It took us 
	more than five years—spreadover the past decade—to come up with this 
	second edition, and it couldn’t have been done withoutthe support and 
	patience of a lot of people.First, we’d like to thank everyone in the C++ 
	community and on the C++ standardization com-mittee.  In addition to all 
	the work to add new language and library features, they spent many, 
	manyhours explaining and discussing their work with us, and they did so 
	with patience and enthusiasm.Part of this community also includes the 
	programmers who gave feedback for errors and possibleimprovement for the 
	first edition over the past 15 years.  There are simply too many to list 
	them all,but you know who you are and we’re truly grateful to you for 
	taking the time to write up your thoughtsand observations.
