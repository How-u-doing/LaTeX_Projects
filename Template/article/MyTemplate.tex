The first and most common use of templates is to supportgeneric programming,
that is, pro-gramming focused on the design, implementation, and use
of general algorithms. Here, ‘‘general’’means that an algorithm can
be designed to accept a wide variety of types as long as they meet
the algorithm’s requirements on its arguments. The template is C++’s
main support for generic pro-gramming. Templates provide (compile-time)
parametric polymorphism.There are many definitions of ‘‘generic programming.’’
Thus, the term can be confusing. How-ev er, in the context of C++,
‘‘generic programming’’ implies an emphasis on the design of generalalgorithms
implemented using templates.Focusing more on generative techniques
(seeing templates as type and function generators) andrelying on type
functions to express compile-time computation are calledtemplate metaprogram-ming,
which is the subject of Chapter 28.The first and most common use of

introduces function templates. Function templates are functions that
are parameterizedso that they represent a family of functions.1.1
A First Look at Function TemplatesFunction templates provide a functional
behavior that can be called for different types. In otherwords, a
function template represents a family of functions. The representation
looks a lot like anordinary function, except that some elements of
the function are left undetermined: These elementsare parameterized.
To illustrate, let’s look at a simple example.nsurehelveticaisembedded\_()Chapter

\subsection{Class template}

When we call a function template such asmax()for some arguments, the
template parameters aredetermined by the arguments we pass. If we
pass twoints to the parameter typesT, the C++ compilerhas to conclude
thatTmust beint.However,Tmight only be “part” of the type. For example,
if we declaremax()to use constantreferences:template<typenameT>T max
(Tconst\& a, Tconst\& b)\{returnb < a ? a : b;\}and passint, againTis
deduced asint, because the function parameters match for int const\&.

in \LyX . However, we can also import them by source files, see 4.3.1
